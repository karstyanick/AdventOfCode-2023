# Advent of Code in Rust ðŸŽ„

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges implemented in Rust. Each day's folder contains the Rust source code used to solve the respective problem.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event featuring daily programming puzzles throughout December, crafted to test coding skills in various domains. It's a fun way to learn new concepts, algorithms, and languages while enjoying the holiday spirit.

## Structure

- **Each Day's Folder**: Inside this repository, you'll find folders named `day1`, `day2`, etc., representing each day's challenge.
- **Rust Code**: Within each day's folder, you'll find the Rust source code (`dayX.rs`) used to solve both parts of the specific problem as well as the inputs.

## Running the Solutions
You can run the main.rs file in the root directory and via command line input select the day you want to run.

### Using Cargo
If you prefer using Cargo. From the root directory you can run:

```bash
cargo run
```

This command will compile and execute the Rust code for the specific day.

### Using Rust Compiler (rustc)
Alternatively, you can compile and execute the Rust code manually using the Rust compiler. From the root directory run:
Compile the Rust code:
```bash
rustc src/main.rs
```

Then, execute the compiled binary:
```bash
./main
```
### Contributions
Contributions, improvements, and alternative solutions are welcome! If you have a better approach or want to add your solution, feel free to submit a pull request.

### Disclaimer
These solutions aim to solve the challenges in a straightforward and functional manner. However, there can be multiple ways to approach each problem. The focus is on readability, correctness, and clarity.

### Acknowledgments
Thanks to Advent of Code for creating these engaging puzzles, and to the Rust community for support and inspiration.
